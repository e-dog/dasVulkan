This was generated with `VK_HEADER_VERSION` **`303`** so you need `vulkan.h` and `volk.h` with the same header version or newer.

Alternatively, you can re-generate bindings by providing `generate.py` with the URL of the desired Vulkan specification XML. You can find the latest one at https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/blob/main/xml/vk.xml
